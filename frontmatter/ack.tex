\chapter{Acknowledgements}

I cannot begin to express my thanks to my advisors, Drs. Julie B. Herbstman and Marianthi-Anna Kioumourtzoglou. I chose Columbia for my PhD specifically to work with Julie in children's environmental health, and everyday I am glad that I did. I have grown so much in the last five years thanks to her invaluable contributions to my training and encouragement of my research interests. Marianthi sat down with me one-on-one during my $2^{nd}$ year and taught me how to simulate realistic data; more than half of this dissertation is based on simulations, so I am not exaggerating when I say that I could not have done this without her. I would not have been able to produce this body of work without their expertise and guidance, and I am deeply grateful to them for their personal and academic support.

I am additionally deeply indebted to my committee members for their expertise and advice. Drs. Jeff Goldsmith, Gary Miller, and John Paisley provided constructive comments and critical contributions throughout these projects. Jeff and John, especially, have helped me to digest pretty technical material, and I am extremely grateful to them for their patience and outstanding ability to break down complex concepts.

I want to thank several more Columbia professors who have been influential during my time here. I have learned so much from Dr. John Wright and everyone on the PRIME team about statistics/machine learning and interdisciplinary collaboration. I would like to extend special thanks to Drs. Frederica Perera and Joe Graziano who both encouraged me to pursue a PhD and who have been role models ever since. I would further like to thank Dr. Pam Factor-Litvak who taught me how to complete my first epidemiological analysis during my MPH and whose feedback was instrumental in my being awarded an F31 fellowship. I also want to thank Drs. Christine Mauro and Brandon Pearson; I had the pleasure of working with them both as a teaching assistant, and learned a great deal from them.

I cannot leave Columbia without thanking my fellow students, current and former, for being wonderful colleagues, teachers, and friends. Special thanks to Dr. Vrinda Kalia, Sarah McLarnan, and Merijn Verstraaten for being so responsive to frantic last minute questions about the discussion section. This program would not have been the same without Drs. Whitney Cowell, Mike He, Sarah Kramer, and Yanelli N\'{u}\~{n}ez, Ahlam Abuawad, and Sebastian Roland. I would like to additionally acknowledge the staff at Columbia's Center for Children's Environmental Health; this work would not have been possible without their personal commitment to the study participants and the Center's mission to create a world in which every child has a healthy start.

I want to end on a more personal note with thanks to my family and friends. I would not be here if not for my parents; they fought for my education and are my biggest advocates. Special thanks to my mom who always thought that I would become a scientist. I would also like to thank my sister Margaret S. Gibson for being my lifelong counterpart and closest confidante and for checking in incessantly these last few months. Finally, I sincerely thank Carter Tazio Schonwald for finding all my bugs and encouraging me to take risks.
