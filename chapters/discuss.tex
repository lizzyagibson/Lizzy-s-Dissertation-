\chapter{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
\clearpage

This dissertation aimed to adapt pattern recognition methods employed in other fields (e.g., computer vision and machine learning) to environmental health data. We modified existing methods to remove the researcher from pattern number selection or specification, to retain the interpretability of a parts-based representation of data, and to explicitly account for uncertainty in identified patterns. We further incorporated this uncertainty in a hierarchical health model to understand the relationships between identified patterns of EDC exposure and child cognitive development. In this final chapter, we discuss our findings and their implications in three main sections: in Section~\ref{sec:summarize} we summarize our results and discuss their position within environmental mixtures research, in Section~\ref{sec:future} we discuss future research directions, and in Section~\ref{sec:ph} we conclude with the public health relevance and implications of our work.
